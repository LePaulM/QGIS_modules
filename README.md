## copy_folder_to_folder.py
Module made in PyQGIS. 
This module was created for an engeneering entreprise to easily create a project from a template folder. It is useful in the model builder if you want to copy a folder to another folder and rename it. It takes 3 entries :
 - Name of the folder to create,
 - Template Location,
 - Created folder destination.
